# Example Inputs and Outputs

This directory contains an example script used to run the simulation `benchPEP_benchmark.sh` and the coresponding output log. The required result of the benchmark is the Performance ns/day figure giving the number of nanoseconds simulation time which would be completed in 24 hours.

**PLEASE NOTE!!!!**:

The input file benchPEP-h.tpr is too large to be hosted on Github, the files for that .tpr are hosted at https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/benchPEP-h
